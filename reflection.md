This project involved styling an existing HTML file using CSS to match a provided design. The primary challenge was achieving pixel-perfect alignment and implementing visual features such as gradients, borders, and spacing adjustments.

Key accomplishments include:

1. **Design Matching**: Successfully matched the layout and styles to the provided screenshot, including detailed adjustments like background gradients, text alignment, and box shadows.
2. **Responsive Adjustments**: Made interactive elements, like buttons and input fields, visually appealing and functional with hover effects and precise sizing.
3. **Attention to Detail**: Ensured all elements, such as headings, lists, and links, adhered to the design's specifications, including font choices and colors.

Challenges included fine-tuning alignment for nested elements like images and text. These were resolved using CSS properties like `padding`, `flexbox`, and `text-align`. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of CSS specificity and layout techniques.
